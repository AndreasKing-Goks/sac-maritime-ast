## Check Tensorflow-CUDA-CuDNN compatibility
Visit this website: https://www.tensorflow.org/install/source#gpu.

Proper Tensorflow installation, visit this website: https://www.tensorflow.org/install/pip#windows-native.

Currently project is run in a local computer, Windows native.

Tensorflow depedencies required is listed in *sac-test-gpu.yml*. Need to downgrade Numpy <2 because of compatibility issues.
